    <p>O son, if ever thou art granted the fortune of dwelling in the countryside and set foot in a land where folk are closer to nature and have washed their hearts from the deceit of cities, know that therein lies true blessing, not in hoarding gold or silver.</p>

    <p>And if thou seekest to know the noble ways of humble folk, turn thy gaze to a village called <strong>Takam</strong> — a verdant place with gentle breezes, forested hills encircling it, and earth made bountiful by the milk of cows. The people there are distant from guile and close to virtue; they chase not after trickery, nor are they enslaved by coin — their aim is the milk of cattle and the bread of the hearth.</p>

    <p>When the season of leaf-fall draws near and trees don fresh green garb, the youth of that land, light of foot and glad of heart, venture into the forest, bearing a tool called <strong>Efondareh</strong> — a light and handy sickle used to cut leafy branches from the trees.</p>

    <p>These leaves they gather in bundles, fastened with a slender twisted branch called <strong>Bandi</strong>, and this whole bundle they name <strong>Khal</strong>. Upon their shoulders they hoist the Khal and return to the village like warriors from conquest.</p>

    <p>The cows — especially the gentle milk-giving kind known as <strong>Mango</strong> — upon seeing the Khal, yearn for it and devour it with joy. Thus nourished, their udders grow full, and by nightfall, sweet milk overflows.</p>

    <p>Among the customs of that village, one is this: at dawn, a member of the household takes a vessel called <strong>Godoosh</strong> and walks with grace to the cow, calling her with a sweet hum and milking her with gentle hands.</p>

    <p>The warm milk is brought home, and the lady of the house sets bread in the clay oven and prepares eggs with butter made from yesterday’s milk. This she serves with hot bread and a joyful heart for all beneath that roof.</p>

    <p>And know, O son, though such a meal may seem lowly to those of the city, to one who has known the serenity of the village, it is a feast fit for kings.</p>

    <p><em>As Rika has said:</em></p>

    <blockquote>
      Blessed is the food eaten with contentment,<br>
      And bountiful is the yield that comes from care.<br><br>
      If thou tend the cow with love, her milk shall be abundant;<br>
      And if the cow be gladdened, sorrow shall not visit the home.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Therefore, if thou desirest peace of heart and lawful nourishment,<br>
    Keep Mango content and prepare the Khal,<br>
    For in this lie the joys of the world and the health of the soul.</p>
