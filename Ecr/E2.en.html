  <h1>On the Morning Ways of Village Folk</h1>

  <p>My son, if ever you find yourself in a land they call the village, where hearts are pure and souls are in harmony with the earth, then turn away from gold and might — for a different treasure dwells there.</p>

  <p>Know that in such a land, dawn does not come with the ringing of clocks, but with the crow of a rooster echoing through the courtyard and the lowing of cows who await their master's kind hand.</p>

  <p>The birds too, upon branches tall, do not idle but rather sing their own tongues — be it finch, great tit, or robin — weaving a hymn of life as morning breaks anew.</p>

  <p>The man of the house rises and tends to his cows, milking them with affection. Then he sends them off to graze in the forest, where they feed in freedom and strength returns to them. And lo! the cows return at dusk of their own accord.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the women kindle fire beneath dry branches gathered from the forest floor, called "himeh". Upon this fire they cook rice — known as "pela" — and break eggs into fresh cow's butter, making golden omelets. Beside this, a bowl of village yogurt completes the midday meal.</p>

  <p>For their early and late repast, there is fresh bread, some cheese, and tea brewed with a handful of leaves and a few cubes of sugar. All is wrapped in a handwoven cloth, woven by village women in the evening by wooden looms with white and blue threads in striped pattern.</p>

  <p>The cloth is tied at four corners and hung from a tool called "efondareh", then slung over the shoulder as they go to the fields — for labor is devotion, and tilling the land is honest sustenance.</p>

  <p>The fields, though outside the village, lie close to the heart. For it is there that livelihood is born, and life sustains itself.</p>

  <blockquote>
    If you seek peace in body and joy in soul, eat from the work of your own hands, and bear not the burden of others’ charity.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Labor is the crown of man, and idleness, rust to the heart.<br>
    He whose hands are worn from toil, his soul shall rest in ease.<br>
    Bread earned with sweat is sweeter than morsels begged with shame.<br>
    True life is built by one’s own hands, not borrowed from others.
  </blockquote>
