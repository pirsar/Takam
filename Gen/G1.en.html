    <h1>Memorial of Kel Seyd Agha</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>O kind-hearted and pure-spirited friend! Listen to a heartfelt and instructive story of a man of noble nature, Karbala’i Seyyed Agha, known in the land of Takam as Kel Seyd Agha, famed far and wide for his generosity, effort, and sincerity. He hailed from a noble lineage, migrants from the village of Khalkheil, several farsangs away from Takam, resting on the southern slopes along the route to Kiasar. Yet it was his inner gem and relentless striving that placed him atop the peak of honor and greatness.</p>

    <blockquote>
      If you strive, you will find help;<br>
      Sorrow will never bring you to your knees.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Kel Seyd Agha was among those who sought not comfort in idleness, but dignity in honorable toil. By his own efforts, he fashioned a modest life and earned lawful sustenance for himself and his family, while extending helping hands to the poor and the distressed.</p>

    <p>During the months of Muharram and Ramadan, when people’s hearts incline towards companionship, each year he made the hall of village (Tekyeh) a place of feeding and generous feasting, nourishing people’s bodies and spirits alike. His home was also a refuge for children from distant villages lacking schools, who stayed there to have the light of knowledge dispel the darkness of ignorance.</p>

    <p>His devoted wife, Kel Seyd Kolsoom, was a virtuous, learned, and proud woman, who in an era of female illiteracy, was graced with the light of education and had recited the Qur’an nine times. Such a lady was the jewel of the household and the pride of the family.</p>

    <p>Two children remained as the family’s legacy: Mir Yahya, famously known as “Seyd Baba,” and Zeynab Khatoon, both renowned for their virtue and commendable character.</p>

    <p>And when the inevitable cycle of fate turned, fifty-four years ago, Kel Seyd Agha laid down his face in the veil of dust, and in honor and greatness, was buried in the courtyard of the hall (Tekyeh) in Takam. His dear wife passed away eight years later, leaving behind a noble name. Seyd Baba, after many years of effort and goodness, closed his eyes twenty years ago.</p>

    <p>A saying left by Seyd Baba remains like a gem of wisdom on the tongues of the people:<br>
    <strong>“An empty hand is no good.”</strong><br>
    It is the proverb of a man whose return from the field after the day’s work was never in vain, carrying a bundle of grass from the riverbank for the cattle.</p>

    <blockquote>
      A noble person does not return empty-handed;<br>
      Wherever he goes, he returns elevated.
    </blockquote>

    <p>O friend! Know that effort and generosity adorn the soul of a human being. Whoever wishes to leave a good name must serve others and embrace kindness. A wise woman, like Kolsoom, is the crown of the household, and knowledge is a treasure that showers light and blessings upon the family.</p>

    <p>Good children are the shade of the parents’ efforts and righteousness. Raising them is like gardening, which requires daily watering of the sapling of kindness with the water of wisdom, as “Rika” says:</p>

    <blockquote>
      The father is one who burns like a candle day and night,<br>
      So the child may receive light and brilliance.
    </blockquote>

    <p>And know also that serving people has its roots in serving God; whoever walks that path gains both worldly honor and eternal dignity. Good words, like the morning breeze, refresh the soul and incline the heart to goodness.</p>

    <p>So, dear friend, take heed from the story of this family and make their path the torch of your own way, for they are in the book of time lines of kindness and effort, and their memory on people’s tongues is as the flower on spring’s skirt.</p>
